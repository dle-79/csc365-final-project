## Description

We will be building the backend for a recipe finder application. It will generate recipes for you given the items you have in your pantry. Additionally, it can find recipes and meal plans to match given nutritional goals, optionally prioritizing ingredients you already have. We can support diet restrictions (i.e. vegan, paleo, etc.). Nutritional goals can be macros (such as protein/carbs) and/or caloric intake.
